For example:

inline func()
{
  return 100;
}

int main()
{
  func();
}


Error : undefined reference to `func'


Above error is due to the compiler cannot inline the function. This is typically caused by a flow-of-control complexity that prevents the optimizer from inlining the function. 
In these cases, the compiler reverts to treating the function as a regular function. To resolve this error, static keyword should be added before the inline. 
Using static keyword forces the compiler to consider this inline function in the linker, and hence the program compiles and run successfully.
